Paper: Good-enough production: Selecting easier words instead of accurate ones

**Abstract**

While many implicit decisions are the result of a trade-off, trade-offs in word use, such as whether a producer meant to convey a message more aligned with kitten despite saying a more accessible word like cat, are difficult to measure. To test the trade-off between message alignment and accessibility, we designed an artificial language where word meanings corresponded to angles on a compass. In a novel language communication game, participants trained on some words more than others (high- vs low-frequency), and then earned points by producing words, occasionally requiring an implicit decision between a high- vs low-frequency word. A trade-off was observed across four experiments, such that high-frequency words were produced even when less aligned with messages. Since high-frequency words are more accessible, these results suggest that implicit decisions between words are impacted by accessibility. Of all the times that people have said cat, many times they likely meant kitten.
